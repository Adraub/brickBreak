/****Brick breaker****/

A game realized during a student project, working with C++ and SFML library. Please, feel free to play! :)

You can choose your level on the main menu using the directional pad and then press enter.
Once playing a level, you can deplace the bar either with the directional pad or with the mouse/touchpad. If you feel like the game is going too slow, just press "V", and your bar will have a superpower: the ball will be faster each time it hits the bar (in blue)!
The green balls are bonuses that can be either good or bad... Just figure it yourself!

Have fun! :)
